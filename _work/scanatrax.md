Scanatrax is a static pallet and cargo dimensioning system that delivers fast, accurate and reliable results, with full after-sales support.

Atrax build products used by 800+ airports, 100+ countries and for 25+ years and one of the products is Scanatrax which is a volume scanner system. ATRAX Scanatrax consists of one or more laser scanners mounted on the rotating beam. When measurement is activated, the laser scanners rotates around the object and produce a result with three dimensions i.e. Height, Width and Length of the object.
