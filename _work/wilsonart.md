### Global Leaders in High Pressure Decorative Laminates

I had the opportunity to design and develop the website for Wilsonart, a prominent name in the world of high-pressure decorative laminates. This project was undertaken at Phosphor, where I collaborated closely with a team of skilled designers and developers.

### Initial Concept and Wireframing

Low-Fidelity (LoFi) Wireframes: The project kicked off with designing LoFi wireframes. This crucial step involved laying out the basic structure and navigation of the site. It was an iterative process where we refined our ideas into tangible wireframes, ready for client review.

### Client Collaboration and Approval

Client Review and Approval: After presenting the initial wireframes, we received valuable feedback from the client. Their insights played a pivotal role in fine-tuning our designs. Thankfully, our efforts paid off with the client signing off on the wireframes - a significant milestone!

### High-Fidelity Designs

High-Fidelity (HiFi) Wireframes: With the green light from the client, we progressed to the HiFi design phase. This stage was marked by incorporating detailed design elements, aligning closely with Wilsonart's brand aesthetics. Multiple iterations and client feedback sessions culminated in another sign-off, paving the way for development.

### Development

Front-End Development: Armed with approved designs, I dove into the development phase. Utilizing a combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Sass, and adhering to the BEM methodology, I transformed the HiFi designs into a fully functional website. This phase demanded a meticulous translation of design into code, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Project Handover

Client Handover: Upon completion, the website was rigorously tested and reviewed. Post final tweaks and optimizations, the website was successfully handed over to the client, marking the successful culmination of the project.

This project was a testament to the power of collaborative effort and iterative design and development. The end result was a visually appealing and functionally robust website that resonated well with the client's needs and brand identity.
