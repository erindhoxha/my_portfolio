### Project Overview

Our journey with the NZPG Showroom design commenced with an in-depth discussion with the client to understand their vision and requirements. The client provided us with a comprehensive brief, outlining their expectations and goals for the project.

### Conceptualization and Ideation

The initial phase involved brainstorming and ideation sessions to conceptualize the application's core ideas. We collaborated closely with the client to define the desirable achievements of the NZPG Showroom design. These discussions laid the groundwork for the project and set the stage for the design process.

### LoFi Wireframes

To visualize our ideas, we began with the creation of Lo-Fi wireframes. The primary objective was to establish a basic structure and iterate on potential solutions and best practices. The Lo-Fi wireframes provided a tangible foundation for the project, facilitating ongoing discussions and refinements.

Then we designed the lofi view of the products page as well.

### HiFi Wireframes

With the Lo-Fi wireframes approved, we transitioned to the Hi-Fi design phase. This involved incorporating typography and design elements from Prime Panels, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.
