### Conference on Software Development

In partnership with DebugCon, I embarked on a project to enhance user experience and establish a new brand identity for their international software development conference. This project was a blend of creativity, technology, and strategic planning, aimed at showcasing the conference in a fresh and engaging way.

### Project Inception

The project began when a client from overseas reached out with a vision for a conference in Pristina, Kosovo. Intrigued by the potential of this venture, I embarked on a comprehensive research journey. This involved analyzing a variety of conferences globally, extending beyond the realm of technology to include medical and engineering events, providing a diverse perspective on conference design and execution.

_Design Phase_

### Moodboard and Ideation

The design process commenced with an extensive moodboard creation, drawing inspiration from various conferences. The goal was to craft an original and captivating design that resonated with the ethos of DebugCon. The branding was influenced by the aesthetics of VS Code, incorporating elements like brackets and a coding-centric color palette.

### Sketching and Prototyping

With the brand colors set - a striking combination of black and purple - the focus shifted to branding. Initial steps included user testing for color accessibility, particularly for color-blind users. The logo design underwent several iterations, eventually leading to a clean and minimalistic final version.

### Building the Website

With the branding finalized, the development phase began, utilizing HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Gulp.js, and JavaScript, along with jQuery. Patterns from www.heropatterns.com were integrated into the design. All images, icons, and the loading screen were meticulously crafted using Adobe Illustrator as SVGs, and animated on the website through JavaScript.
