### How it started?

We started with discussing with the client and they sent as a brief of the requirements of the NZPG Showroom design.

We discussed about the idea and what would be the desirable achievement from this application.

Initially, I came up with a Lo-Fi wireframe, laying down the foundation and having iterations with the client about best solutions and good practices.

Then we designed the lofi view of the products page as well.

After signing off the lofi designs, we gathered the typography, design system from Prime Panels and started the Hi-Fi design.

Then we designed the hifi view of the products page as well.

After we signed off the design, we've built it with JavaScript, HTML5, SASS, Tailwind, .NET.
