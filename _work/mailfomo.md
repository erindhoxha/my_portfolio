### Collecting sources of news into an email

Mailfomo is a daily top links aggregator, sending you the most popular links of the day to your email. Never fear of missing out again.

Styled with SASS and Tailwind, developed with React and for authentication used JWT authentication as a client-side-based stateless session.

### Idea

The inception of Mailfomo came from the need to streamline the consumption of news from various sources. Scrolling through subreddits, Twitter, and news sites like HackerNews can be time-consuming. Mailfomo addresses this issue by aggregating news from these platforms and delivering it directly to users' inboxes.

Currently, it supports content aggregation from Reddit, HackerNews, and Twitter. Users can personalize their news feed by selecting specific sources or topics of interest.

A single view of adding a single source, such as Subreddits.

The sources page, where the user would link their favourite sources with their email address, which would be sent daily.
