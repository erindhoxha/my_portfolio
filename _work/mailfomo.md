### Collecting sources of news into an email

Created Mailfomo website to collect sources of news and send them to our users into an email.

Styled with Tailwind, developed with React and for authentication used JWT authentication as a client-side-based stateless session.

### Idea

It came as an idea as it was time consuming to scroll through the subreddits and news sites (Frontend, Hackernews etc) and I've created this website that you can choose which sources you want to get data daily from.

Currently it supports only reddit, hackernews and twitter.

Website is offline due to spending reasons but I can share the code & subscribe you in if you're keen to receive news. :)

Github repo on request.
